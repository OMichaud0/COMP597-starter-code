# Slurm

The experiments require access to GPUs to train machine learning models. We have obtained access to the SOCS GPU nodes for all students in the course. Jobs can only be run on those nodes using [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html). Find below some information about the setup.

## Accessing the GPU nodes

McGill IT has some documentation about accessing the GPU nodes. You can find it [here](https://docs.sci.mcgill.ca/COMP/slurm/). The account for this course is `energy-efficiency-comp597` is the QOS is `comp597`.
